## Overview

One card component.

Used Sass for styling.

Mobile-first styling.

Used BEM for class names and thought a good HTML structure first before styling it.

Flexbox / Grid

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- [CSS reset](https://github.com/mayank99/reset.css) - To baseline cross-browser styles

### What I learned

- To use flexbox inside of a card. Elements by default such as image and buttons were stretched, had to use align-items: start.
- To never use height on any element, except for icons.
- To use height/width on icons.
- To avoid using :link and :visited if I want them to have the same styling.
- To use a button modifier class using BEM: product-card__cta

### Continued development

My main focus is still to create a well-structured HTML first. Also to keep implementing what I've learned for this project. Next step, to use class modifiers following BEM and not general CSS nomenclature.
